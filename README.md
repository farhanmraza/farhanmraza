# Hi, Iâ€™m Farhan ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m a Computer Science and Engineering student passionate about AI, machine learning, and building solutions that connect technology, design, and sustainability. I work across software development, data science, and engineering systems to solve genuine real world problems. I usually focus on energy systems with environment based technologies, and on projects that work with AI, analytics, and data insights. I have an interest in both, and for my own projects, I strive to find unique ways to connect them together. Some fun facts about me is that I run a car business, volunteer in healthcare & energy conservation non-profits, and I customize my own skateboards!

### Skills
- Programming: Python, Java, C++, SQL
- Data & AI: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, PyTorch
- Engineering & Design: CAD, 3D modeling, design optimization, stress analysis
- Tools: AWS, Azure, Tableau, Power BI, Git

### Featured Projects
- Water Conservation Tracker â€“ Full-stack web app for tracking and reducing water usage.
- Energy Efficiency Dashboard â€“ Data visualization and forecasting for energy consumption.
- Vehicle Efficiency Optimizer â€“ Machine learning model to predict and improve MPG.
- P.S. Iâ€™m actively migrating projects here and adding new ones regularly. This repo is part of an ongoing portfolio, so more projects should be coming in soon.

### Volunteering
- Engineers Without Borders â€“ Designed and implemented sustainable water & energy systems.
- Atrium Health â€“ Supported patient systems, awarded Gold Presidential Volunteer Service Award.
